### 🏅 Sports

  My favorite teams are the **Golden State Warriors**, **San Francisco 49ers**, and **Tottenham Hotspur**, and some of my favorite athletes include **Stephen Curry**, **Gareth Bale**, and **Harry Kane**. I've also visited 18 different sports venues in 5 countries - the best, so far, have been the **Panathenaic Stadium** in Athens and **Tottenham Hotspur Stadium** in London. 

### 🧳 Traveling

  Working for an airline gave me the unique opportunity to casually travel the world on my days off! I've visited **25** countries and **24** U.S. states and territories. Over the years, I've taken off **125** times and counting, comprising over a **quarter of a million miles**, and have spent the night in **10** different airport terminals around the world.
  
  Some of my favorite places I've visited are **London, England**; **Kamakura, Japan**; and **Saint Petersburg, Russia**. 
  
  On my list of places to see next are **Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia**; **Phnom Penh, Cambodia**; and **Vatnajökull, Iceland**. 

### 🛩️ Aviation

  I often look forward to the airport and the plane ride as much as I do the vacation itself! Some of my favorite airports are **San Francisco (SFO)**, **Singapore (SIN)**, **New Orleans (MSY)**, and **Tokyo-Narita (NRT)**. 
  
  My aviation-related hobbies include arriving at SFO early to admire the Lufthansa Boeing 747-800 that flies in from Frankfurt every day, and reading Wikipedia articles about obscure airports and airlines. Currently, my favorite planes are the **Boeing 787 Dreamliner** and the **Airbus A321neo**, both of which I've been very fortunate to fly on several times with United.
