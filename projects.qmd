Some of the fun stuff I've worked on, ranging from machine learning models to sports analytics research.

### ðŸ”¢ Machine Learning & Data Science  
- **Airline Route Similarity Research**

    Current project I'm working on. I'm using flight telemetry data to identify possibly unexpected parallels between major U.S. flight corridors and international routes. 

- [**OpenL3 Music Recommendation System**](https://github.com/stevenluchen/openl3_recommender)

    Built my own music recommendation pipeline because I got tired of Spotify's built-in recommendation algorithm. Feel free to try it yourself! 

- [**Large Language Model & Retrieval-Augmented Generation**](https://github.com/stevenluchen/LLM-RAG)

    Developed RAG system optimizing retrieval strategies for Meta KDD Cup 2024 CRAG benchmark. 

- [**Denoising Autoencoder for CIFAR-100**](https://github.com/stevenluchen/denoising-autoencoder){target=_blank}  

    Trained a convolutional autoencoder to reconstruct noisy images and improve feature representation.  

- [**Reddit Social Network Analysis**](https://github.com/stevenluchen/reddit-social-network-analysis){target=_blank}

    Built a graph neural network framework for social network analysis, including GCNs, GATs, and node embeddings.

### âš¾ Sports Analytics 
- [**NFLPA Analytics Case Competition**](https://github.com/kevbaer/nflpa_24){target=_blank}

    Clustered contract data of NFL players and presented data-driven recommendations to NFLPA leadership. 
    
- [**The Launch Angle Revolution**](https://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/post/launch-angle){target=_blank}

    Examined the impact of elite MLB hitters' average launch angle on statistics and performance. 
    
- [**Predicting the Group Stages of the 2022 FIFA World Cup**](https://www.bruinsportsanalytics.com/post/predicting_fifa_wc_2022){target=_blank}

    Developed a statistical model based on statistics in qualifying to forecast results for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Outperformed models developed by researchers at University of Oxford, Opta Sports, and others.
