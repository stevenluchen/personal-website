    "text": "My academic and professional interests include big data, machine learning, blockchain, and artificial intelligence, but you probably already knew that. Outside of work, I like:\n\n\nüèÖ Sports\nMy favorite teams are the Golden State Warriors, San Francisco 49ers, and Tottenham Hotspur, and some of my favorite athletes include Stephen Curry, Gareth Bale, and Harry Kane. I‚Äôve also visited 18 different sports venues in 5 countries - the best, so far, have been the Panathenaic Stadium in Athens and Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.\n\n\nüß≥ Traveling\nWorking for an airline gave me the unique opportunity to casually travel the world on my days off! I‚Äôve visited 25 countries and 24 U.S. states and territories. Over the years, I‚Äôve taken off 125 times and counting, comprising over a quarter of a million miles, and have spent the night in 10 different airport terminals around the world.\nSome of my favorite places I‚Äôve visited are London, England; Kamakura, Japan; and Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nOn my list of places to see next are Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia; Phnom Penh, Cambodia; and Vatnaj√∂kull, Iceland.\n\n\nüõ©Ô∏è Aviation\nI often look forward to the airport and the plane ride as much as I do the vacation itself! Some of my favorite airports are San Francisco (SFO), Singapore (SIN), New Orleans (MSY), and Tokyo-Narita (NRT).\nMy aviation-related hobbies include arriving at SFO early to admire the Lufthansa Boeing 747-800 that flies in from Frankfurt every day, and reading Wikipedia articles about obscure airports and airlines. Currently, my favorite planes are the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus A321neo, both of which I‚Äôve been very fortunate to fly on several times with United."
